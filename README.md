```bash
# The hooks run automatically on commit, but you can also run them manually:

# Check everything
npm run build && npm run lint && npm run format

# Fix formatting issues
npm run format:write

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Skipping Hooks (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Only in emergencies - skips all pre-commit checks
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency commit"
```

**Note**: All commits should pass these checks to maintain code quality and prevent CI failures.
